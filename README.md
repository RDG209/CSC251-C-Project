# Gradebook Project - persistent records with sorting and updates
 - Manage a simple student records file that survives across runs. Support adding, finding, updating, deleting, and listing students; compute a few basic statistics. For ordering, implement your own selection or insertion sort on a chosen key (e.g., by name, by ID, or by average). Robustness beats features: parse defensively, write safely (consider write-to-temp then replace), and avoid unsafe input functions. A strong submission shows careful structure (model, storage, sort, ui), clear handling of malformed data, and a short demo that exercises add→list→sort→update→stats without corrupting the file.
