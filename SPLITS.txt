1) Data Handling
BUILD: gradebook.c and gradebook.h

FUNCTIONS: 
add_student(id, name, grade) - Add new student to arrays
find_student(id) - Search for student by ID, return position
update_student(id, new_grade) - Change a student's grade
delete_student(id) - Remove student from arrays
get_student_count() - Return how many students we have
get_student_data(position) - Get ID, name, grade for position X

DATA TO MANAGE:
student_ids[] (integers)
student_names[][] (strings)
student_grades[] (floats)
student_count variable (integer)

 - Test Data Handling by defining hardcoded 3+ students and testing all functions


2) File Managing
BUILD: storage.c and storage.h
FUNCTIONS:
load_from_file() - Read from "students.txt", fill the arrays
save_to_file() - Write all student data to "students.txt"
file_exists() - Check if data file exists
FILE FORMAT: One student per line: ID,Name,Grade

 - Test File Managing by manually writing a txt in the right format and print it out correctly, save it under a different name, and ensure the checker works


3) Sorter/Calculate
BUILD: sort.c and sort.h
FUNCTIONS:
sort_by_id() - Rearrange arrays in order of student ID (all 3 arrays need to be changed with each sort)
sort_by_name() - Rearrange arrays in alphabetical name order (all 3 arrays need to be changed with each sort)
sort_by_grade() - Rearrange arrays by grade (high to low) (all 3 arrays need to be changed with each sort)
calculate_stats() - Compute simple stats (min, max, average grades)
show_stats() - Print the simple statistics (min grade, max grade, avg grade should be sufficient IMO)

 - Test Sorting with hardcoded unsorted data, like a dummy id/name/grade arrays 


4) User Interface
BUILD: ui.c and ui.h
FUNCTIONS:
show_menu() - Display menu options to user (infinite while, switch statement)
get_menu_choice() - Read what user types (optional, you can combine this into show_menu())
Options:
 add_student() - Get ID, name, grade for adding students
 show_student() - Find and display one student's info neatly by id (use (1) find_student funct)
 update_student() - Update a student (call funct from (1))
 delete_student() - Delete a student (call funct from (1))
 sort_students() - Sorts students, asks user what to sort them by (use functs from (1))
 show_all_students() - Display all students nicely formatted
 close() - end the menu and display a farewell message

 - Test User Interface with printf statements in the options to ensure the menu selections works well



main file will use:
#include "gradebook.h"
#include "storage.h"   
#include "sort.h"
#include "ui.h"

To load in ubuntu, ensure all files are in the right folder and run:
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror gradebook.c main.c storage.c sort.c ui.c -o gradebook

I believe .h files are more akin to interfaces while the .c has the actual code.
